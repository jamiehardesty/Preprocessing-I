      <h2>Intro to Luci!</h2>
      <p>Luci is the deuteragonist in Disenchantment. Jamie's favorite alias of his is "Cat Thing". He lives in Dreamland, is Princess Bean's "personal demon", and is the owner and bartender at <i>Luci's Inferno</i>. He is voiced by Eric Andre.</p>

      <h2>What are Luci's skills?</h2>
      <p>Luci's behavior is chaotic and seemingly random in places, yet in others, it is pivotal to moving things forward. Luci's actions vary from encouraging worse-than-normal behavior and actively disrupting events to being helpful in a crisis.</p>
